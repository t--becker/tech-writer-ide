# TODOs

  * Insert markdown link -> either inserts and empty markdown link or creates a link from a highlighted selection
  * Numbered lists -> turn selection into a numbered list
  * Bullet lists -> turn selection into a bullet list
  * Add codeblock fences for javascript, php, ect
  * Insert image -> could be emtpy image example of turns a selection into an image
