# TODO

* ~~Insert markdown table -> I always forget what a markdown table looks like, one click and it inserts a nice, empty one~~

* Markdown heading validator -> I always screw up the headings, so automatically check these.

* Visual Github integration -> Use the d3js library to show a visual representation of github branches (http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083) allow to commit and merge branches by dragging these the streams together.

* JIRA Integration
  * Show your tasks
  * Allow you to update and close tasks
  * Scan the page and create tasks for keywords : TODO-JIRA:
